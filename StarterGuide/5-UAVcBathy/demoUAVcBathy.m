% This script is designed to demonstrate the cBathy Toolbox in production
% mode and in debug mode. It also demonstrates some of the plotting
% functions to investigate cBathy results. It was developed as a
% demonstration for CIRN Boot Camp #1, 3/2017. It is designed to be stepped
% through line by line while reading the comments.

clear

% find the path to the cBathy Toolbox
cBathyToolboxPath = what('cBathy-Toolbox');

% cd to the cBathy Toolbox directory to run demo
cd(cBathyToolboxPath.path)

% look at the contents of the toolbox
help cBathy-Toolbox

%% set to production mode and process
% First open the "settings" file argus02a.m in the editor and look at inputs
edit argus02a

% run the cBathyDemo
democBathy

% look at cBathy result compared to survey plotted in figure 1

% look at the output variable names in the command window
whos 

% plot the different components for each frequency of cBathy output
figure
examineSingleBathyResult(bathy)

% plot the fCombined cBathy result (left panel) and the fCombined error
% (right panel) of figure 2
figure(2)
plotBathyCollect(bathy)

%% run again in debug mode
% set to debug mode by changing value of params.debug.production = 0
% in argus02a.m 
edit argus02a

% pre-open figures and set colormap to jet to view that phase maps more
% clearly
figure(10)
colormap jet

figure(11)
colormap jet

% run cBathy again in debug mode
democBathy

% In the debug mode, cBathy will ask at the command line if you want to 
% look at a subset of the cBathy domain. You only want to look at a few 
% pixels in the middle of the cBathy domain for debugging. Copy and paste
% these values for the range of pixels to look at: 
%[250 275 25 700 725 25]

% follow instructions in command window

% get rid of all of those plots
close all

% plot the cBathy matrix in time to look like a low resolution movie (you 
% should see waves)

%% run the Kalman filter demo
% should step through Kalman filtered results with 2 second pause between
% results

% compare the prior Kalman filtered bathymetry, the updated bathy, and the
% updated Kalman filtered bathymetry
plotBathyKalmanStep(bathy, priorBathy)

% In the plot, the upper left panel is the prior
% Kalman filtered bathymetry, the lower left panel is the prior Kalman
% filtered error, the upper middle plot is the updated bathymetry from cBathy
% phase 2, the lower middle panel is the updated error from phase 2, the
% right upper panel is the phase 3 Kalman filtered bathymetry, and the
% phase 3 error
