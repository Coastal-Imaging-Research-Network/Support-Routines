CIRN Function dependencies (given as a tree)

*Note: read the tree vertically from top to bottom, and read a single indent 
as 'calls'. For example, if the tree was:

	function1
		function2
			function3
		function4

This should be read as 'function 1 calls function2 and function4, while 
function2 calls function3.'
